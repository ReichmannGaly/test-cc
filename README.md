# test-cc

## Overview
This repository, named '**test-cc**', features a refactored JavaScript code designed to enhance organization and improve performance. 
The refactoring focuses on streamlining code logic and providing a more organized structure.

## Changes made
- **Switch Statement for Menu Options**: The original if-else statements used for handling user input have been replaced with a switch statement. This modification contributes to code conciseness and enhances overall code comprehension.

## Program complexity
The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the number of iterations in the while loop. This is because the function will continue looping until the condition is false, and the number of iterations depends on the user's input.

The space complexity of this program is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of memory for the input variable and the condition variable.
